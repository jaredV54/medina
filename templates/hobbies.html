        <h3>Playing Sims 4</h3>
        <p>I enjoy playing The Sims 4 because it allows me to express my creativity and imagination in a unique, interactive way. 
        From designing dream homes to creating diverse characters and guiding their lives, the game gives me total freedom to build 
        and explore different stories. It’s both relaxing and inspiring—whether I’m decorating a house or experimenting with mods,
        I find myself completely immersed in the process. It’s also a fun way to escape reality while still engaging in strategic 
        thinking and creative decision-making.</p>

        <h3>Photography</h3>
        <p>Photography is one of my favorite hobbies because it allows me to capture moments, emotions, and perspectives that often go unnoticed.
        I love experimenting with lighting, composition, and angles to tell a story through each photo. Whether I’m shooting landscapes, portraits, 
        or candid moments, photography helps me see the world more mindfully and appreciate its details. It’s a creative outlet that constantly 
        challenges me to improve while giving me a way to express how I see the world.</p>

        <h3>Watching Movies</h3>
        <p>Watching movies is one of my favorite ways to relax and unwind. I enjoy exploring different genres—from thought-provoking dramas to lighthearted comedies
        and visually stunning animations. Movies allow me to experience new perspectives, cultures, and emotions, all from the comfort of my own space. I’m especially 
        drawn to strong storytelling, compelling characters, and creative cinematography. Whether it’s an indie film or a blockbuster, I find that movies not only entertain
        but also inspire and spark new ideas.</p>

        <h3>Playing Badminton</h3>
        <p>Playing badminton is one of my favorite physical activities because it’s both fun and energizing. I enjoy the fast-paced nature of the game, 
        which keeps me active, sharp, and focused. Whether I’m playing singles or doubles, badminton helps improve my reflexes, coordination, and endurance 
        while also relieving stress. It’s a great way to stay healthy and socialize with others, and I find it incredibly rewarding to challenge myself and 
        see my skills improve over time.</p>

        <h3>Handmade Floral Crafting</h3>
        <p>Handmade floral crafting is a hobby that brings me both joy and relaxation. I love working with different materials—like paper,
        fabric, or dried flowers—to create beautiful and unique floral arrangements by hand. Each piece is a chance to express creativity 
        and attention to detail, whether I’m making a simple bouquet or a more intricate decorative piece. It’s a calming, rewarding process
        that allows me to blend color, texture, and form in artistic ways, and it’s especially meaningful to see how something handmade can 
        brighten someone’s day or space.</p>
